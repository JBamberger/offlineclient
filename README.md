# Current state

Various code snippets patched together to test functionalities and libraries. Nothing functional / usable.
The code is by no means complete or functional. Some functions rely on non-public APIs that may change at any time and therefore break functionality. Some features require root access to function.


# Original intention

Android app that downloads contents from various content providers and caches them locally for usage without network access.
